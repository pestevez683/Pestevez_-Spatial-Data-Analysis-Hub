# Sentinel-2 and TRMM Analysis
This script utilizes Google Earth Engine to analyze seasonal changes in vegetation (NDVI) and precipitation using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and TRMM precipitation data. It filters images by dates, removes clouds, calculates NDVI, and generates time series charts for different points of interest. Additionally, it creates compositions of NDVI for the dry and wet seasons, as well as RGB composite images for visualization.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have access to Google Earth Engine and are authenticated.
2. Copy and paste the script into the Google Earth Engine Code Editor.
3. Modify the script parameters as needed, such as the region of interest and date range.
4. Run the script to visualize the seasonal changes in vegetation and precipitation
